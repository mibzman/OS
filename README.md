# BlackDOS Project, Spring 2018

### Currently, this OS can:

1. Accept string or integer input
2. Print strings or integers

Currently on startup the OS runs an example game of madlibs.  This game accepts several inputs, and prints out a story congaing those inputs to the printer.  This is output to the printer.out file.

This can be tested by running compileOS.sh.  The result should run in the boch emulator.

### Note:

Currently the OS has been observed to crash on startup.  This occurs sporadically, and when run again (rarely after as many as 3 attempts) the machine boots as expected.  The cause of this is currently unknown.
