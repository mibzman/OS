### Currently, this OS can:

1. Accept string or integer input
2. Print strings or integers

Currently on startup the OS runs an example game of madlibs.  This game accepts several inputs, and prints out a story congaing those inputs to the printer.  This is output to the printer.out file.

This can be tested by running compileOS.sh.  The result should run in the boch emulator.

### Note:

Currently the OS has been observed to crash on startup.  This occurs sporadically, and when run again (rarely after as many as 3 attempts) the machine boots as expected.  The cause of this is currently unknown.

## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY PLEDGE 
- I have not used source code obtained from another student nor any other unauthorized source, either modified or unmodified.
                                                                       
- All source code and documentation used in my program is either my original work or was derived by me from the source code published in the textbook for this course or presented in class.
                                                                       
- I have not discussed coding details about this project with anyone other than my instructor. I understand that I may discuss the concepts of this program with other students and that another student may help me debug my program so long as neither of us writes anything during the discussion or modifies any computer file during the discussion.
                                                                       
I have violated neither the spirit nor letter of these restrictions.
